# Movie_Sentimental_Analysis

https://cinemetric.herokuapp.com/

Cinemetric is a Movie Review Sentiment Prediction webapp and has visualizations to understand the economic impact of movies in Hollywood over the last 2 decades.

On this website we try to predict if the sentiment of a movie review is Positive or Negative. We used Python and Beautifulsoup for webscraping the data from the boxofficemojo website.
Classification and Prediction of the review was done by a Linear SVM Machine Learning model; MongoDB was utilized for data storage; JavaScript, D3.js, Plotly and Tableau for the front end visualizations and deployed the app on Heroku.

This project would not have been possible without the efforts of my wonderful teammates Suhas Karanth, Raj Sisodia, and Amber Sidhu , M.Eng , EIT.

I would also like to Thank Kasturi Kundu, MMA, B.Eng., Jason Grein and Sadaf Sadeghian for their valuable advise and guidance throughout the project.
